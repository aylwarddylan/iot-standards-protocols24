## OPERA CLOUD API

Utilizing the OPERA Cloud Hospitality API to make requests, gathering information on room status from the Hotel's Booking System.
This room information will be utilized to set future heating operations.

### Other Data Collection Examples
This same principle could be utilized in other building scenarios where booking systems are not the norm.
For e.g., an office space could have IoT compatible Occupancy Sensors at entrances to floors, or on a per room basis. This information could be utilized as input for specific operating conditions of the heating system.

# A Smart IoT Based Monitoring and Optiisation of Heating Systems in Buildings
IoT Systems refer to networks of interconnected devices with capacities to sense, actuate, and exchange data over the internet. The Internet of Things (IoT) provides the opportunity for physical devices to obtain and send data, interact with their surroundings, and execute different tasks without any human involvement.
This Project aims to integrate application layer technologies such as occupancy systems into an overall Building management system

This Project aims to integrate application layer technologies such occupancy systems to an overall Building management system. 

Using this to create functionality where future events will allow for the predictive operation of the heating system of a building. The integration in summary, aims to enhance a heating schedule and will optimize its performance based on real-time & future changes in occupancy, where the occupancy system e.g. in a hotel is the booking system.

We also aim to integrate digital radiator valve sensors into the iot system, to set a responsive schedule for the rooms where valve will open to heat the room if a minimum temperature is met, or close if a maximum temperature threshold is met. This is aimed to be linked to the enhanced Building management system and set-point temperatures can be automatically adjusted depending on occupancy levels. 

These digital valves will be connected to the newly created & Building management system, where heating profiles can be automatically created for sections of the building depending on future occupancy. We see a benefit in integrating the mentioned systems as there would be future potential to then create additional IoT functionality to the Building Management System, e.g. responsive controls to plant equipment based on real-time data sensing in a building.

Thus, the overall aim is to integrate different application layers (occupancy system, which feeds to BMS or heating system operational scheduling, and also room sensors which can feed to heating system or temperature control in room), we see this as an improvement and further enhancement to exisitng building management processes.

## Significance of the Project

This project would contribute to the advancement of smart IoT systems in the monitoring and optimisation of buildings. It would facilitate the development of effective and efficient heating control applications that would enhance occupants' comfort and carbon reduction. Also, it would contribute to the improvement of the predictive accuracy of building occupancy, which would be instrumental in the formulation of policies for building management in some homes and businesses.

In addition, the digital radiator valves will be included among the sensors in the IoT system that will create responsive schedules for the rooms where the valves will open to heat the room when the room temperature drops below the desired temperature, and close when the maximum threshold is reached or the windows of the rooms are open. This is intended to be connected to the improved Building management system by which set-point temperatures can then be automatically altered depending on the number of people inside the room/building. These digital valves will be wired alongside the newly installed & building management system, where heating profiles that are specific to sections of the building can be automatically generated depending on future occupancy.

The mentioned systems bring us a benefit in further integration as we could then create added IOT functionality to the Building Management System and get responsive controls to plant equipment based on information coming from buildings in real-time.

## Tools, Technologies and Equipment

Digital Thermostatic Radiator Valves (TRVs): These are innovative devices, that can manage the temperature of a building or a house individual radiator remotely. They can be programmed to turn on or off and controlled remotely.

LoRaWAN Network: LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) is a kind of low-power, wide-area networking protocol integrated to enable wireless battery-operated device communication over long distances. It is developed specifically with the Internet of Things (IoT) applications in mind that need long-range communication, low power consumption, and secure data transmission.

Motion Sensor: A motion sensor is a device that detects movement within the surrounding environment. Upon detection of people, the sensor sends signals.

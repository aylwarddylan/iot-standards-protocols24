This Project aims to integrate application layer technologies such occupancy systems to an overall Building management system. 

Using this to create functionality where future events will allow for the predictive operation of the heating system of a building. The integration in summary, aims to enhance a heating schedule and will optimize its performance based on real-time & future changes in occupancy, where the occupancy system e.g. in a hotel is the booking system.

We also aim to integrate digital radiator valve sensors into the iot system, to set a responsive schedule for the rooms where valve will open to heat the room if a minimum temperature is met, or close if a maximum temperature threshold is met. This is aimed to be linked to the enhanced Building management system and set-point temperatures can be automatically adjusted depending on occupancy levels. 

These digital valves will be connected to the newly created & Building management system, where heating profiles can be automatically created for sections of the building depending on future occupancy. 

We see a benefit in integrating the mentioned systems as there would be future potential to then create additional IoT functionality to the Building Management System, e.g. responsive controls to plant equipment based on real-time data sensing in a building.

Thus, the overall aim is to integrate different application layers (occupancy system, which feeds to BMS or heating system operational scheduling, and also room sensors which can feed to heating system or temperature control in room), we see this as an improvement and further enhancement to exisitng building management processes.


## Tools, Technologies and Equipment

Room sensors that have additional functionality i.e. digital radiator valves, networking layers such as LoRaWAN. Communication layers to improve functionality between application layers & hence improve the equipment operation & systems mentioned.

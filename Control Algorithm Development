# Data Retrieval
The first step is to gather the necessary data to make informed decisions. This includes:

Occupancy Data: Fetching data from the hotel booking system to determine whether rooms are occupied, unoccupied, or will soon be occupied.
Current Room Temperature: Retrieving the current temperature readings from the digital thermostat valves in each room.

# Decision Logic
Based on the data retrieved, the algorithm decides the optimal temperature settings for each room. This logic can be broken down into several rules:

## Rule-based Conditions
If the room is unoccupied: Set the valve to a lower temperature.
If the room is occupied or will be occupied within the next few hours: Adjust the temperature to a predefined comfortable level based on guest preferences or standard settings.
Special Cases: Consider special cases like long-term unoccupancy, where you might set the heating to an even lower maintenance level.

# Control Commands
After determining the required action for each room:

Send Commands: Communicate with the digital thermostat valves via the LoRaWAN network to set the desired temperatures. This involves constructing command packets that are sent to the valves, instructing them to open or close to the required levels.

# Scheduling and Timing
Real-Time vs Scheduled: Decide whether the system should operate in real-time (reacting to changes as they happen) or on a schedule (checking room statuses at fixed intervals, e.g., every hour).
Pre-heating Logic: Implement logic to start heating rooms a certain time before they are occupied based on how long it typically takes to bring a room up to a comfortable temperature.

# Feedback Loop
Monitoring: Continuously monitor the effectiveness of the settings and the actual temperature achieved in the rooms.
Adjustment: Allow for manual adjustments and learn from these adjustments to optimize automatic settings over time.

# Algorithm Optimization
Machine Learning: Over time, incorporate machine learning techniques to predict more accurately when rooms will be occupied and the optimal start times for heating based on historical data.
Energy Consumption Analysis: Integrate feedback on energy consumption to refine temperature settings and reduce costs further without sacrificing guest comfort.

#  Development Tools and Techniques
Simulation: Before implementation, simulate the algorithm using historical booking and temperature data to refine the logic and ensure it behaves as expected.
Programming Languages and Tools: Depending on the existing hotel IT infrastructure, you might use Python, Java, or C# for backend development. Use APIs for data retrieval and command sending, and ensure robust error handling and security are in place.
